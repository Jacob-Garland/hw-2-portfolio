            <h1>Who is Jacob M. Garland?</h1>
            <h2>A tech savvy!</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <h2 class="content-subhead">Introduction</h2>
            <p> Hey y'all! My name is Jacob MacKenzie Garland; father, construction contractor, and future software/web development engineer! I'm 28 years old, a Florida native, 
                and I've always embraced a dying passion for computers. Some other hobbies and interests I have are that I am a car enthusiast and mechanic, tattoo artist, and 
                video game buff. I am a currently enrolled as a student at University of Central Florida for their Coding Bootcamp. 
            </p>
            <h2 class="content-subhead">Childhood</h2>
            <p> As a child, I spent every hour of freetime tinkering with my video game consoles, dvd players, tvs, computers, mp3s 
                and more. Maturing further into high school, I had a tendency to explore more on the software side along hardware. Modifying the software on my video game consoles and 
                games, finding fun third party things I could do with my cell phones. In respects to my dinosaur PC (yes, I still have my old Windows Vista desktop. Not my first or my best
                but certainly my favorite) I would install software and hardware mods and use them to modify other electronics, trying to figure out how they all worked. As an adult now, 
                I'm working to take that passion and turn it into a career! I've been learning coding languages to build websites and applications such as this very one you're using right 
                now! I soon expect to be working in the tech industry with skills built from hands-on learning at UCF through edX. I have been learning to master skills in HTML, CSS and 
                its frameworks, Javascript, Node.JS with npm, Express.JS, Typescript React, MongoDB, Python, and many more. With these skills, I've set a big goal of someday working for 
                Publix or X, on their respective websites and mobile apps. 
            </p>
            <h2 class="content-subhead">Current</h2>
            <p> So stay tuned for more projects to be added to this in the future, displaying my skills and progress. I plan to actively update this site as a personal blog of everything
                I create in my career coding as a developer/programmer. 
            </p>
            <p>
                As of now, I'm confident enough with front end development that I can declare I'm currently seeking employment by any company at the entry level for a junior web developer.
                 My current knowledge range is limited to front end development and some back end deployment. However, upon completion of my enrollment at UCF, I will graduate in March 
                 2025 with knowledge for Full Stack web development. For hiring companies, I am seeking remote work. I would accept remote/hybrid work in:
                <ul>
                    <li>Chicago, Illinois</li>
                    <li>Seattle, Washington</li>
                    <li>Dallas/Ft. Worth, Texas</li>
                    <li>anywhere in Texas or Florida</li>
                </ul>
                I am currently located in Florida, but my family and I are willing to relocate. I can be best reached via email for scheduling any interviews and resume requests.
            </p>
            <p>
                For prospective clients, I'm open to freelance work coding smaller websites for businesses (I support small businesses E) and have design contract templates already made.
            </p>
