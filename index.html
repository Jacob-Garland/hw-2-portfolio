                <p>Hey y'all! My name is Jacob Garland; dad, car enthusiast, and future software development engineer! At 27 years old, I am a Florida native born and raised. I have always 
                    had a passion for electronics and computers, spending all my long hours of freetime as a child tinkering and taking apart my game consoles, dvd players, and more. Maturing 
                    further into high school, I had a tendency to explore more on the software side rather than hardware. Hacking game consoles, phones, messing with code in my video games
                    even. Now, as an adult, I'm taking that passion and turning it into a career! During my education at UCF in the software development bootcamp, I will be developing 
                    webpages and applications as I learn new programming languages. On this website, I will be adding my very best to display as a working, interactive portfolio.
                </p>
