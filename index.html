               <h2>About Me</h2>
               <div>
                <p> Hey y'all! My name is Jacob Garland; dad, car enthusiast, and future software development engineer! I'm 28 years old, a Florida native, and I have always 
                    had a passion for computers. I spent long hours of freetime as a child tinkering and taking apart my game consoles, dvd players, and more. Maturing 
                    further into high school, I had a tendency to explore more on the software side rather than hardware. Modifying the software on my video game consoles and 
                    cell phones, as well as my PC. As an adult now, I'm working to take that passion and turn it into a career! I've been learning coding languages to build websites
                    such as this working, interactive portfolio. With skills built from hands-on learning in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
                </p>
                <p> I'm also working on building skills in Typescript, Python, Node.JS with npm, and more. So stay tuned for more projects to be added in the future, displaying my skills! 
                </p>
