               <div>
                <p>Hey y'all! My name is Jacob Garland; dad, car enthusiast, and future software development engineer! At 27 years old, I am a Florida native born and raised. I have always 
                    had a passion for electronics and computers, spending all my long hours of freetime as a child tinkering and taking apart my game consoles, dvd players, and more. Maturing 
                    further into high school, I had a tendency to explore more on the software side rather than hardware. Jailbreaking and modifying the software on my video game consoles and 
                    cell phones. Now, as an adult, I'm taking that passion and turning it into a career! During my education at UCF in the software development bootcamp, I will be developing 
                    webpages and applications as I learn new programming languages. On this website, I will be displaying my very best applications as a working, interactive portfolio.
                </p>
                <p> If you want to chat and get to know me more, have questions or comments, or have business inquiries/job offers, all of my professional contact information can be found in the 'Contact Me'
                    section further down this page. The fastest way of reaching me would be to email. 
                </p>
