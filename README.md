# Jacob Garland's Portfolio

## Project Desciption

This is an interactive website I have created to display my working portfolio. As a software developer, I wanted to create an easily accessible and functional portfolio to display completed projects for potential employers. To do this, I used my knowledge learned in HTML and CSS to develop the base webpage. 

More to be built and projects to be displayed at a later time.
